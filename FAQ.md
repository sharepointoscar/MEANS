======================

### How do I add a new MEANS?

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add new features on the fork with tests
3. When finished, send a pull request to this repository.  One of the moderators will check it out, make sure it works, provide feedback, and potentially suggest some tweaks.
4. When everything is rock-solid, we'll add your code as a new repository in this Github organization, and give you admin access so you can make edits, add other committers, close issues, merge pull requests, etc.

Thanks for contributing!
